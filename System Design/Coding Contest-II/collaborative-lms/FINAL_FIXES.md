# Final Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Top Categories Cards Not Clickable
**Before:** Category cards only set state but didn't navigate
**After:** Category cards now navigate to `/courses?category=CategoryName`
**Result:** Clicking any category (Technology, AI, Design, etc.) takes you to courses page with that category pre-filtered

### 2. ✅ Search Feature Not Working
**Before:** Search only filtered on same page
**After:** Search redirects to `/courses?search=query` with results
**Features:**
- Search button click navigates to courses page
- Enter key also triggers search
- CourseListingPage reads URL params and filters accordingly
**Result:** Search now works from home page and shows filtered results

### 3. ✅ Profile Photo Upload/Change
**Before:** No way to change profile photo
**After:** Full profile editing functionality
**Features:**
- Edit Profile button on profile page
- Can update: Name, Bio, Avatar URL
- Avatar preview before saving
- Updates persist in database
- Profile photo shows in navbar and profile page
**Result:** Users can now customize their profile with photo and bio

## New Backend Endpoints

### PUT `/api/users/profile`
Updates user profile (requires authentication)
```json
Request:
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "bio": "Professional instructor",
  "avatar": "https://example.com/photo.jpg"
}

Response:
{
  "_id": "...",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "bio": "Professional instructor",
  "avatar": "https://example.com/photo.jpg",
  "role": "instructor"
}
```
